# mm-extract
Extracting human readable pre-training data from set.mm

Install metamath in the `metamath-0.198` directory. 

`proofs.txt` is generated by running `echo -e "set scroll continuous\nset width 999999\nsh p */lemmon" | ./metamath ./set.mm > proofs.txt` in the `metamath` directory. After creating it, move it from `metamath-0.198` to the top level directory. Then run `make_data.py`.
